Scene 1 description:
* Camera on tripod in portrait or landscape orientation
* Scene filled (or mostly filled) by grey card
* Illuminated by simple light source, for example a desk lamp
* Uniformity of lighting and target positioning need not be precise

This is intended to be a very simple setup that can be recreated on an
engineer's desk without any large or expensive equipment. The tests for this
scene in general only look at a patch in the middle of the image (which is
assumed to be within the bounds of the grey card).
