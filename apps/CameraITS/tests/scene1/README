Scene 1 description:
* Camera on tripod in portrait orientation
* Scene filled (or mostly filled) by grey card
* Illuminated by simple light source, for example a desk lamp
* Uniformity of lighting and target positioning need not be precise

This is intended to be a very simple setup that can be recreated on
an engineer's desk without any large or expensive equipment.
